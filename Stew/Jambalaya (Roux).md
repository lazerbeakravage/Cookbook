## It's cooking time!
1. Heat the oven to 350Â°F.

8. Cook 1 minute more, then stir in the stock. Bring to a low simmer over medium-low and stir in the 2 tablespoons salt.
9. Simmer for 1 hour, then stir in the sausage and rice.
10. Nestle the chicken on top, cover, and bake 30 minutes.
11. Carefully remove from the oven and stir in the butter and scallions.
