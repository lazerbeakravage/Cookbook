## Ingredients

#### Dry aging
- Wrap in at least three layers of the cheesecloth, which will allow air flow while preventing the outer surface of the roast from hardening. 
- Position the wrapped roast so that the ribs are facing downward and stash on the lower level of the refrigerator (set no lower than 34°F and no higher than 38°F) for 5 to 7 days. There’s no need to change the cheesecloth during this time.
  
#### 3 rib roast
- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 1 tbsp fresh ground black pepper
- Canola oil to coat the meat

#### Yorkshire pudding
- 4 tbsp Rib drippings (can be replaced by canola)
- 4 large eggs
- 2 cups whole milk
- 2 cups (280g) flour
- 1.5 tsp salt

## Roasting
1.  Initial roasting
    - Place a probe thermometer into the center of the roast and set its alarm for <span style="color:red"><b>118°F</b></span>.

    - Set the roast on the lower middle rack in a cold oven and turn the oven to <span style="color:red"><b>250°F</b></span>.

    - About 3 hours for a 3-bone roast or up to about 4 hours for a 4-bone roast. (It is more important to keep an eye on the temperature than the time here; your times may vary depending on the exact weight and shape of the roast.)

    - Remove the roast from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, cover with foil, and let rest while preparing the pudding. (The roast’s internal temperature should rise up to around <span style="color:red"><b>130°F</b></span>, then very slowly start to fall.)

    - Pour off the drippings from the sheet pan into a heat-proof liquid measuring cup. 

    - Let the roast rest for 30 minutes. Hang on to the sheet pan and rack; you’ll use it again later.

2.  Yorkshire pudding
    - Place 12" cast iron skillet in <span style="color:red"><b>400°</b></span> oven

    - In a blender, add 2 tbsp of the drippings, eggs, milk, flour, and salt

    - Coat the cast iron with 2 tbsp of the drippings and bake for 30 min

3.  Reverse Sear
    - <span style="color:red"><b>500°</b></span> for 10-15 minutes
