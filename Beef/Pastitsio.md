## **Cooking time!**
1. Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
2. Make the meat sauce: 
   - Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. 
   - Add onion and garlic; cook and stir gently until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. 
   - Increase heat and add ground beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. 
   - Stir in tomatoes, wine, broth, tomato paste, parsley, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and clove. Cover and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.

3. Meanwhile prepare the pasta: 
    - Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
    - Add pasta and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. 
    - Drain.

4. Pour melted butter, 1/4 cup grated cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper over pasta; toss well and cool briefly. 
    - Add 2 eggs and toss again; set aside. (didn't add the eggs)

5. Make the béchamel: 
    - Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. 
    - Add flour; cook and stir for 2 minutes. 
    - Pour in milk and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. 
    - Cool slightly before stirring in 1 cup grated cheese, beaten egg, and egg yolk. 
    - Then stir 1/2 cup of béchamel sauce into meat sauce. (maybe 1/3 of the bechamel)

6. To assemble pastitsio: 
  - Arrange pasta in the bottom of the prepared baking dish so that all of the noodles are nicely lined up and are as level as possible for a great visual effect when serving. 
  - Spoon meat sauce over pasta; top with remaining béchamel sauce, spreading evenly. 
  - Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup grated cheese on top.

7. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden brown on top, about 50 minutes.
