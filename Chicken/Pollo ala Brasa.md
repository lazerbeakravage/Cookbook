Authentic Pollo a la Brasa Recipe
Ingredients:

## For the Marinade:

- 1 whole chicken (3-4 pounds), spatchcocked (butterflied)
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon chili powder (or aji panca paste for a more authentic - taste)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar (or white vinegar)
- 1 tablespoon mustard (optional for extra tanginess)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground oregano
- 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (or lemon juice)
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro (optional, finely chopped)
- Salt to taste (approximately 1 to 1.5 teaspoons)
- For the Side (Optional):

Prepare the Chicken:

Start by spatchcocking the chicken (butterflying it), which means cutting out the backbone so the chicken lies flat. You can ask your butcher to do this for you, or use kitchen shears to remove the backbone yourself. Press down on the breast to flatten the chicken for even cooking.
Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. This helps the skin crisp up during cooking.
Make the Marinade:

In a large bowl, mix together the minced garlic, cumin, paprika, chili powder, soy sauce, vinegar, mustard (if using), vegetable oil, black pepper, brown sugar, coriander, oregano, lime juice, and salt.
Stir in the chopped cilantro (if using). This mixture will have a paste-like consistency that will coat the chicken.
Marinate the Chicken:

Rub the marinade generously all over the chicken, making sure to get it under the skin where possible (especially on the breast). Be sure to coat the entire chicken with the marinade for full flavor.
Cover the chicken with plastic wrap or place it in a resealable bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but ideally, marinate overnight for maximum flavor.
Cook the Chicken (Rotisserie or Grill Method):

Rotisserie: If you have a rotisserie oven, set it to 350°F (175°C) and cook the chicken for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) and the skin is golden and crispy.
Grill Method: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 350°F). Set up your grill for indirect heat. Place the chicken on the cooler side of the grill (away from direct flames) and cover. Grill for about 1 to 1.5 hours, turning occasionally, until the chicken is fully cooked and the skin is crispy. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches 165°F.
Serve:

Let the chicken rest for about 10 minutes before carving.
Serve with French fries, salad, and/or rice on the side. You can also add some dipping sauce (like green chili sauce or "aji verde") for an extra kick.

This recipe is inspired by traditional Pollo a la Brasa from Peru, especially the preparation and marinade style found in Pardo’s Chicken, one of the most famous chains serving the dish. The combination of spices like aji panca (a Peruvian red chili paste) and the balance of soy sauce, vinegar, and lime juice is a hallmark of the dish's deep, tangy, and savory flavors. You can also find many variations online, but the essential elements of the marinade remain consistent across authentic recipes.
